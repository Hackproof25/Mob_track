1. Colorama Initialization: The `colorama` library is initialized with `init(autoreset=True)` to automatically reset colors after each print statement.
2. Formatted Print Statements: The `print` statements are updated to use colors:
   - Fore.GREEN and Style.BRIGHT for the main title.
   - Fore.YELLOW for the instruction prompt.
   - Fore.CYAN for the user input prompts.
   - Fore.RED for the alert message when the IMEI is detected.
